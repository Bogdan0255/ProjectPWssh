This code automates the password change process for devices using SSH connection and paramiko library. It takes a list of device IPs and updates the password for the specified username. The success and failure of the password change process are stored in separate data frames and saved as Excel files with the current date in the file name. This script can be used to update passwords in bulk for multiple devices with minimal manual intervention.
